-----Before you begin-----

If not already installed, install Node JS on your system. Link = https://nodejs.org/en/download/
install express and express-handlebars using command "npm install express express-handlebars -S"
start application using command "node server.js" 

-----Handlebars-----

Handle bars is a simple templating language. It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions. (This application is written with Handlebars!)

for more information on handlebars see: https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/

-----CVE-2019-20920-----

Handlebars before 3.0.8 and 4.x before 4.5.3 is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript. This can be used to run arbitrary code on a server processing Handlebars templates or in a victim's browser, effectively serving as XSS.

-----PortSwigger Demonstration-----

The lookup helper vulnerability is demonstrated in a PortSwigger lab.

First, I will walk through the PortSwigger lab. Then I will step through the lookup helper code to explain how the vulnerability happened and how it was fixed.
