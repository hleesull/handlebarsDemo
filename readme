-----To use handlebarsDemo-----

(running handlebarsDemo is not necessary to understand the CVE-2019-20920 vulnerability, but it shows handlebars code and the lookup helper.) 
If not already installed, install Node JS on your system. Link = https://nodejs.org/en/download/
install express and express-handlebars using command "npm install express express-handlebars -S"
start application using command "node server.js" 

-----Handlebars-----

Handle bars is a simple templating language. It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions. (This application is written with Handlebars!)

for more information on handlebars see: https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/

-----CVE-2019-20920-----

Handlebars before 3.0.8 and 4.x before 4.5.3 is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. 
The lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript. 
This can be used to run arbitrary code on a server processing Handlebars templates or in a victim's browser, effectively serving as XSS.

-----PortSwigger Demonstration-----

The lookup helper vulnerability is demonstrated in a PortSwigger lab. 
First, walk through the PortSwigger lab. While completing the lab, be sure to read the blogpost on the vulnerability. 
There you will find the code that can be injected into Handlebar templates, look particularly at the one that uses lookup. 
Then read PDF "understanding Handlebars lookup helper" to understnad how the lookup helper vulnerability and how it was fixed.
